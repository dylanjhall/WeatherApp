# Weather App

This App is a designed to allow the user to be able to get weather forecast from the around the world. It is using weather API supplied by https://www.weatherapi.com/.

The purpose of this project is to implement study items from https://github.com/dylanjhall/angular-study-guide and use it as a practical reference for more complex future Angular projects.

 Currently it calls the weather APIs directly. In an upcoming release it will be using a cloud based for process requests and rewrite. This is currently being tested with Azure, but it will include the ability to switch to other cloud solutions such as AWS.
